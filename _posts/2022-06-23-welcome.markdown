> "The crashes people remember, but drivers remember the near misses" - Mario Andretti

hello, its moony (or mubi, now) here. you might know me (mostly) from my adevntures in a certain [tweaking server](https://www.discord.gg/ctt) or have been "social surfing" and stumbled upon my github page. in any case, hello!

I have finally started my blog, after many weeks of procrastination and overthinking. Before I start explaining how I got here, I want to thank Klisper for encouraging me and giving me an idea on what to write about. I also want to thank CTT (and its various members) for giving me the opportunity to grow as a developer and give me loads of content to write about.
